Installed Raspbian.

Was unable to set up RTL8192EU dongle. Seems possible to compile driver, but to do this one needs the Linux source code handy. Oh well.

Installed HostApd via apt-get, then overwrote the executables with a version compiled locally. Checking source archive into repository.
Installed dnsmasq via apt-get
Installed lshw via apt-get (note lshw -C network useful)

Checking in hostapd.conf
Checking in driver for rtl8192

Make sure hostapd valid: sudo hostapd -d /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
Also delete wpa-roam line

sudo service networking restart to ensure network config ok
Note that by editing networking file one can change how wifi dongle behaves
set to master mode with iwconfig wlan0 mode master
